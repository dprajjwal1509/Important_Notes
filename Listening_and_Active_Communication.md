# Listening and Active Communication  

## 1. Active Listening  
**Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)**  
- **Pay full attention** – Stop distractions (phone, laptop, side-talks) and focus completely on the speaker.  
- **Show interest through body language** – Nod, lean slightly forward, maintain comfortable eye contact.  
- **Avoid interrupting** – Let the speaker finish before responding.  
- **Paraphrase or summarize** – Repeat back in your own words what you understood to confirm accuracy.  
- **Ask clarifying questions** – If something is unclear, politely ask questions to dig deeper.  
- **Show empathy** – Acknowledge feelings and emotions (e.g., “I understand this must have been tough for you”).  
- **Provide feedback** – Give thoughtful responses, not just “yes” or “okay.”  
- **Remember details** – Keep track of important points, especially in meetings or learning sessions.

## 2. Reflective Listening  
**Question 2: According to Fisher’s model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**  
In simple words, Fisher’s model suggests:  
- **Listen carefully first** – Don’t prepare your reply while the other person is still talking.  
- **Repeat or rephrase** – Mirror what the other person said in your own words to check if you understood right.  
- **Check feelings as well as facts** – Reflect not only the message but also the emotions behind it.  
- **Confirm understanding** – Ask the person if your summary or reflection matches what they meant.  
- **Encourage openness** – This makes the speaker feel respected and more willing to share honestly.
