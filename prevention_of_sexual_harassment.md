# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH)

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that violates an individual’s dignity or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Examples include:

- **Verbal Behaviour** 
  - Sexually coloured remarks, jokes, or comments 
  - Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours 
  - Repeatedly asking for personal/romantic attention despite refusal 

- **Non-Verbal Behaviour** 
  - Staring, leering, or making gestures 
  - Displaying sexually explicit material (emails, images, posters, memes) 
  - Sending unwelcome messages or inappropriate content digitally 

- **Physical Behaviour** 
  - Unwanted physical contact (touching, patting, brushing against) 
  - Stalking or following someone inappropriately 
  - Forcing or attempting sexual activity 

- **Workplace-related Behaviour** 
  - Promising benefits or threatening career setbacks in exchange for sexual favours 
  - Hostile behaviour or bullying targeting a person’s gender 
  - Excluding, isolating, or demeaning someone based on gender or refusal of advances

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

- **If you face harassment:** 
  1. **Stay firm** – Clearly express that the behaviour is unwelcome. 
  2. **Document the incident** – Note date, time, place, people involved, and any witnesses. 
  3. **Report** – Reach out to the Internal Committee (IC) / HR as outlined in the MountBlue PoSH policy. 
  4. **Seek support** – Approach trusted colleagues, mentors, or professional support if needed. 

- **If you witness harassment:** 
  1. **Do not ignore** – Take the situation seriously. 
  2. **Support the victim** – Encourage them to report and reassure them of non-retaliation. 
  3. **Report directly** – If the victim is hesitant, escalate to HR/IC yourself. 
  4. **Maintain confidentiality** – Protect the dignity of all parties during the process.

## 3. Example Workplace Scenario

**Scenario:** 
An employee repeatedly makes "jokes" about a colleague’s appearance during meetings. Despite the colleague showing discomfort, the behaviour continues. Later, the same employee starts sending personal late-night messages that are not work-related.

**Why this is harassment:** 
- The behaviour is **unwelcome** and makes the colleague uncomfortable. 
- Repeated actions create a **hostile work environment**. 
- Unprofessional personal advances cross workplace boundaries. 

**What should be done:** 
- The colleague can politely but firmly tell the person to stop. 
- If the behaviour persists, they should **document incidents** and report to the Internal Committee/HR. 
- Witnesses (other team members) should **support the victim** and also report the issue to HR if needed.

> **Key principle:** Zero tolerance for sexual harassment. Every individual is responsible for creating a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace.
