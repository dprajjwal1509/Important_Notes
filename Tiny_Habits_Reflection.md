# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits – Reflection and Learnings

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg 
**Q1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
The most interesting idea was how BJ Fogg emphasized starting small, such as flossing just one tooth, to create lasting habits. By reducing habits to “tiny” actions, people can overcome resistance and make consistency easier. This shows that motivation isn’t always the key — simplicity and ease often matter more.

**Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?** 
The formula **B = MAP** means: 
- **B** = Behavior happens when 
- **M** = Motivation, 
- **A** = Ability, and 
- **P** = Prompt (or trigger) come together.
To make habits easier:
- **Increase Motivation**: Link the habit to your values or goals.
- **Increase Ability**: Make the habit simpler (start tiny). 
- **Add Prompts**: Connect the habit to something you already do (like brushing teeth or making coffee). 

**Q3. Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?** 
Celebration creates positive emotions, which help wire the habit into the brain. When you “shine” (smile, cheer, say “yes!”), the brain associates the habit with a rewarding feeling. Over time, this emotional reinforcement makes the habit automatic. Whatever you celebrate becomes something you naturally want to repeat.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day
**Q4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?** 
The most powerful idea was the concept of **compounding improvements** — getting 1% better each day leads to remarkable results over time. Small changes may feel insignificant daily, but when compounded, they transform outcomes dramatically. This shifts focus from dramatic overnight change to steady, consistent improvement.

## 4. Atomic Habits – Book Summary
**Q5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?** 
The book emphasizes **identity-based habits**: lasting change comes when habits align with who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve. For example, instead of saying, “I want to run a marathon,” say, “I am a runner.” Identity-based habits stick because they reinforce your self-image.

**Q6. How to make a habit easier to do?** 
- Reduce friction: Place needed tools in visible and easy-to-reach places. 
- Make it small: Break down big habits into 2-minute actions (e.g., “put on shoes” instead of “run 5km”). 
- Build environment support: Arrange surroundings to naturally encourage the habit. 

**Q7. How to make a habit harder to do?** 
- Increase friction: Put obstacles between you and the bad habit. 
- Make it invisible: Remove triggers from your environment. 
- Make it unattractive: Reframe the habit by focusing on its negative consequences. 
- Limit access: Use tools like website blockers or lock unhealthy snacks away.
