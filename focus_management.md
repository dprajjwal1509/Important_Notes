- Deep Work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.

## 3. Are Deadlines Good for Productivity?

- Deadlines create focus by limiting time.

- Balance: enough pressure to focus, but not so much it leads to burnout.

## 6. Intentionally Creating Diffused Mode
Diffused mode allows brain recovery, creativity, and problem-solving.  
Activities that support this:  
- Meditation  
- Walking without digital devices  
- Standing or sitting in silence  
- Lying down in silence (Shavasana)  
- Doing chores with mindful attention (cleaning, washing dishes)

## 7. Getting Started on Difficult Tasks
Procrastination often comes from avoiding fear, boredom, or frustration.  

**Technique: “One step at a time” / “Action precedes motivation”**  
- Step 1: Work for 30 seconds on the task.  
- Step 2: Take a break.  
- Step 3: Remind yourself you are capable (affirmations).  
- Repeat steps 1–3 and gradually extend work time.  

**Key Idea:** Build undeniable proof of progress → confidence grows → identity shifts.
